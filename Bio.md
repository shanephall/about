## Mini Bio Current 
```
I recently completed a 8-year tenure at Change.org, where I led Product, AI/ML, and Growth teams for a platform serving 500M+ users. As Director of Product, I built cross-functional teams and delivered features that increased email conversion 2.5x, onsite conversion 4x, and monetization 5x.

Previously, I scaled Product and Design teams at The Hunt, culminating in its acquisition by Pinterest, and led the relaunch of Zynga.com, growing it to 1M daily active users within 3 months.
