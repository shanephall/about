## ðŸ‘‹ Hello


I'm Shane Hall, a product and technology leader with a passion for building impactful products and high-performing teams.

Most recently, I led Product, AI/ML, and Growth teams at Change.org, a global platform serving 500M+ users. As Director of Product, I built cross-functional teams and delivered step-change improvements to email conversion (2.5x), onsite conversion (4x), and monetization (5x).

Previously, I scaled Product and Design teams at The Hunt, culminating in its acquisition by Pinterest, and led the relaunch of Zynga.com, growing it to >1M DAU within 3 months.

## Let's Connect

Working on an interesting **problem** or **product** - let's connect!

I love chatting with fellow product leaders, AI/ML nerds and folks building impactful products.
